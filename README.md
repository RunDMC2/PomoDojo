# PomoDojo

## Welcome to PomoDojo! Here's some general information about the project and what we aim to accomplish!

The PomoDojo mobile app allows users to effectively study while having fun! Effective study methods like the Pomodoro technique will be combined with fun and addictive minigames, to provide a great experience that'll have the player wanting to study even more. 

PomoDojo will allow the user to study in increments of 25 minutes with 5-minute breaks in between, of which will include a simple minigame. 
Over time, the user will be able to unlock more minigames, all of which are simple enough to give a fun playing experience while not over-
exerting the brain. This loop of studying and playing minigames rewards consistent studying and fosters efficiency, and with plenty of
achievements and badges to unlock, PomoDojo will make studying fun again!
