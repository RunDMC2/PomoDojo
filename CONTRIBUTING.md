# How to contribute to PomoDojo!

> **A few things to note! (mostly for after developing more than once)**
> 
> - Make sure you try to **close out of Godot when running Git commands**. It may lead to saving errors if you save files after running Git commands with it open.
> - Be sure to adhere to the minigame guidelines to make sure minigames are uniformly developed
> - Make sure to create a new development branch every time you start working on a new task/issue
>
> Happy coding!


# Getting started:

## Step 0: Download all software and create project source folder
- Make sure to download **Godot Game Engine** v.4, at this link: https://godotengine.org/download/windows/
- Also make sure you have **Git** installed, go to this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
  
- Create a folder to hold all of your project files somewhere easy to access (like your desktop), and name it something like "PomoDojo", but any name is fine.
- Make sure you can access this folder's directory; you will need it later.


## Step 1: Forking the repository
- Go to the UF OSC PomoDojo repository, and press the **fork** button near the top of the screen.
- Keep the name the same if you'd like, then click create fork.

- This is your copy of the repository; make sure your fork is always up to date when submitting changes and contributing, by pressing the **sync** button.

## Step 2: Clone the forked repository
- There are a few ways of using git for this project; you can use whichever method you find easiest.
- They will all do the same thing and navigate to the same directory, but it will just look slightly different.

#### **Using Git Bash (I like this one)**
- Right-click inside your created folder from **Step 0**, and find the option **Open Git Bash here** and click it.

#### **Using Command Prompt**
- Press the Windows key on your keyboard and search for **Command prompt**
- Type **cd "*Your PomoDojo file directory*"** and press enter

Either way, you should now be in your project file directory.
- Now, copy the GitHub URL of your forked repository and type:
- **git clone *URL***, and press enter
- The type **git pull** to retrieve all of the files.

- This has now made a copy of the repository from GitHub onto your local device, and retrieved all of the files into it.


#### Step 3: Making a new branch for what you want to contribute
- This isn't technically required, but I **HIGHLY HIGHLY** recommend it since it prevents you from overwriting all of your code by accident.

- In either Git Bash or the Command prompt, type **git checkout -b *Insert fancy branch name here***, then press enter (Make sure you remember this branch name, we will reference it a lot later)
- This will create a new branch on your computer, which acts as another copy of all the code that you can safely edit without changes interfering with other code until you're ready.
- This command will also now put you into the branch automatically, so any changes to your code will need to be added here.

## Everything should be ready for you to code away in Godot! Let us know if you have any questions!

# Have you made changes and are ready to submit? It's time to submit a Pull Request!

### Step 1: Committing changes
- Open either Git Bash or Command prompt (if in command prompt type **cd *PomoDojo folder name*** first)
- Type **git checkout **branch name**, press enter. This makes sure you are adding commits to your development branch, not your main one.
- Type **git add .** or **git add *specific file local path(s)* if you want to only add a few changed files.
- Then type **git commit -m "*Message here*"**, and keep your message short but informative about what it is you changed

### Step 2: Syncing fork for new commits
- To make sure all files are up to date from updates, go back to your forked repository on GitHub and press the **sync fork** button again
- Then, run **git checkout main**, and then **git pull**, to switch to your main branch and pull any updates in.
- ^^^ THESE TWO STEPS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, as not doing this could lead to merge conflicts or code being lost and deleted.
- Your code in your main branch will most likely change, and it's up to *YOU* to make sure your new changes don't contradict any code from other people
- We are now ready to commit our changes from our development branch to our own local main branch.

### Step 3: Rebase into local main branch
- Run **git checkout *branch name*, then **git rebase main**. This moves into your development branch, then merges your changes into your main branch.
- We are using "rebase" rather than "merge" to form a more linear commit history that is easier to read with many people contributing.

>
> If you get merge conflicts here, that's ok! Make sure to resolve them by reading from your terminal what files are conflicting, closing the terminal, and reopening the Godot files.
> Git should automatically add headers into files where the conflicts take place, so search for "=======" and you should see two versions of code before and after these headers that you need to manually sort through.
> Once the conflict is resolved, resave your files, delete all the header text Git added to the files, and I recommend restarting the rebase from **Step 1: Committing Changes** just to make sure there aren't any issues still.
> If needed to restart the rebase, run **git rebase --abort**, then try to merge your changes again.
>

- Now, run **git checkout main**, then **git rebase *branch name***

### Step 4: Push
- Run **git push**, and your changes should now be in your forked repository on GitHub

### Step 5: Contribute
- Go to your forked GitHub repository, and check if everything is reflected correctly. You should have a new commit in your repo, and your development branch should've been merged into your main branch.
- If you see a green "Compare & Pull Request" button (I don't believe you should see this but just in case it does show up), click it and sort through the changes, and save it.
- Now, click the **"Contribute"** button on GitHub to make a pull request to our main repository.
- Make sure to include a descriptive name for your pull request, outlining what was changed in your commit(s). If you're solving an issue #, try to include the issue number in the pull request name

# Great job submitting a Pull Request, a Tech lead will look over your code and send you updates if anything needs further refinement. Thank you for contributing to PomoDojo!
